# Use Content H1 as Title

This is a demo of a page with no frontmatter (although frontmatter with no title would also work for this test) but with an H1 heading which we use as the page title (name).

Note that on this site this only affects the metadata in the footer of this page since we don't modify the test theme to use this metadata (since we want to avoid a circular dependency, along with other considerations).
