# Use Content H1 as Title

This is a demo of a page with no frontmatter (although frontmatter with no title would also work for this test) but with an H1 heading which we use as the page title (name).

Note that this demo site does not modify the minimal theme on which it is based,
so the title from the Markdown (originally an \<h1>) appears both as the site title
and as the first \<h2> on the page.
